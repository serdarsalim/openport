# OpenPort — Agent Instructions

## What this is

A native macOS app (Swift 6, SwiftUI, macOS 14+) that scans a portfolio folder for npm projects and lets you start/stop their dev servers, see git status, edit ports and go/ aliases, and open each project in the browser, terminal, VS Code, or Finder.

No Xcode. Built entirely with Swift Package Manager.

---

## Rules — do this after every code change

1. Commit all changes to main first
2. `./build-app.sh` — rebuilds the app AND auto-generates `Sources/LocalhostApp/AppVersion.swift` with the current Malaysia time (MYT). The version appears in the app footer.
3. Kill and relaunch: `pkill -x LocalhostApp 2>/dev/null; sleep 1; open "dist/OpenPort.app"`

   The running process is named **`LocalhostApp`** (the SPM product), not `OpenPort` — the
   bundle is what's called OpenPort. `pkill -x "OpenPort"` matches nothing and exits silently,
   and then `open` just fronts the instance that's already running, so you sit there testing
   the old build and wondering why your change didn't land. Verify with `pgrep -lx LocalhostApp`
   before and after: the PID must change.
4. Only commit + push + upload release when user says "push"

Do not ask. Just do it every time, in that order.

Build + relaunch one-liner (always use absolute path for open — shell cwd resets between commands):
```bash
cd /Users/slm/my-portfolio/localhost-3000 && bash build-app.sh 2>&1 | tail -4 && pkill -x LocalhostApp 2>/dev/null; sleep 1 && open "/Users/slm/my-portfolio/localhost-3000/dist/OpenPort.app" && sleep 2 && pgrep -lx LocalhostApp
```

Push one-liner (only when user says push):
```bash
cd /Users/slm/my-portfolio/localhost-3000 && git push && gh release upload v0.1.0 dist/openport-macos.zip --clobber -R serdarsalim/openport
```

---

## Build & run

```bash
swift build -c release      # compile only
./build-app.sh              # compile + bundle + sign → dist/Localhost 3000.app
open "dist/OpenPort.app"
```

## Key decisions & gotchas

### openport.json — the project declares, we stop guessing

Every heuristic in `AppScanner` breaks the moment a project wraps its dev server in a
launcher script. `"dev": "node scripts/dev.mjs"` tells us nothing: not the port it binds,
not how many processes it starts, not whether the backend comes up with it. We used to
auto-assign a port, watch it forever, and paint the row `.crashed` while the app served
fine on a port we never looked at.

So a project can state it outright, in `openport.json` at its root:

```json
{
  "run": [
    { "name": "hubspot", "command": "npm run dev:hubspot", "port": 3012 },
    { "name": "native",  "command": "npm run dev:native",  "port": 3013 }
  ],
  "backend": { "kind": "convex", "bundled": true, "local": true },
  "framework": "next",
  "caches": [".next", ".next-native"]
}
```

Rules that matter:

- **First `run` entry is primary** — it owns the row's port, status, and browser actions.
  The rest are sidecars: started with it, killed with it, each with its own `PORT` env.
- **Declared commands run verbatim.** No `patchPort`, no `applyHostBinding`. We can't parse
  a launcher script, so rewriting it is how we'd break it — which means `bindHost` (LAN
  launcher auto-expose) is skipped for declared projects. That's the trade for reliability.
- **A declared port outranks the store.** `PortStore.assign` overwrites a saved value from
  `declaredPorts`, so a project that once picked up a wrong auto-assignment self-corrects.
  Consequence: editing the port in the UI for a declared app doesn't stick.
- **`backend` is optional and total** — when present it replaces `detectBackend` sniffing
  outright (no merging). Absent, the old heuristics run unchanged.
- **Every key is optional and a malformed file falls back to sniffing**, never hides the
  project. Unknown keys are ignored, which is why `_comment` works.
- A project with `openport.json` and no `dev`/`dev:frontend` script still shows up.

Live examples: `nudge/openport.json` (two stacks), `randevu/openport.json` (one stack whose
port was invisible).

### Port persistence
`PortStore` uses `UserDefaults`. `defaults.dictionary(forKey:)` returns `[String: Any]` — cannot cast directly to `[String: Int]`. Always use `compactMapValues { $0 as? Int }`. This was a root-cause bug — don't revert it.

### Process spawning
Uses `/bin/zsh -c "exec npm run dev"` with PATH set to include `/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin`. The `exec` replaces the shell so `process.terminate()` hits npm directly. Sets both `PORT` and `VITE_PORT` env vars.

### External server detection
`SystemClient.detectRunningServers()` runs two `lsof` calls: one for (pid→port) of listening node processes, one for (pid→cwd), matched by PID. Uses `DispatchSemaphore` with a 4-second timeout to prevent hangs. Detected external servers show as `.detached` status — Stop button sends `SIGTERM` to their PID.

### PortStatus enum
`.free` — stopped, port available
`.starting` — started by this app, process alive, port not bound yet
`.running` — started by this app, port listening
`.detached` — started externally, detected by lsof
`.external` — port in use by an unrelated process
`.crashed` — was started by app but stopped unexpectedly

Port number turns **orange** in the UI when status is `.external`.

**`.crashed` is owned by the ProcessManager termination handler alone.** Never mark crashed
from a port probe: a Convex + Next stack takes ~20s to bind its port, and "started but port
not listening" is `.starting`, not a crash. This misdiagnosis was the original "Play is
unreliable" bug.

### Status polling (AppModel)
`startPolling()` runs forever: every 3s it probes the ports of apps we started (raw
`connect()`, negligible); every 4th tick it calls `refresh(quiet: true)` — full lsof sweep
that adopts a mismatched real port into `detectedPort` and syncs rows for servers
started/stopped in a terminal. `refresh()` preserves `.crashed` + `crashLog` + `startedAt`
from the previous apps array — rebuilding the array must not amnesia away state that only
lives in it. `refreshInFlight` guards manual vs. quiet overlap.

### Auto-open on ready
Play inserts the app into `pendingBrowserOpen`; the first poll/refresh that sees the port
answer opens the browser once (`openBrowserOnReady`, Settings → General, default on).
Crash/stop clears the pending flag so a failed boot doesn't open a dead tab later.

### Vite and ports — the one framework that ignores PORT
Vite reads neither `PORT` nor `VITE_PORT` (we still set both for apps whose config reads
them). For sniffed Vite projects the port travels as a CLI flag: `npm run dev -- --port N
--strictPort`, or — when the dev script wraps the frontend (`convex dev --start "npm run
dev:frontend"`) — the script body is run directly with the flag threaded into the quoted
inner command (`applyPortBinding`, wrapper-aware for both quote styles, npm-aware for
inner `npm run` commands). `--strictPort` makes a collision fail loudly in the logs
instead of silently drifting to 5173. Declared (openport.json) commands stay verbatim.

Framework sniffing sees through one level of `npm run X` indirection:
`AppScanner.expandScriptReferences` appends referenced script bodies into `sniffScript`
(detection only, never executed) — that's how `convex dev --start "npm run dev:frontend"`
with `"dev:frontend": "vite"` is recognized as Vite.

### No Git column
Removed deliberately (user never used it) along with GitClient — a git subprocess per
project per refresh was the most expensive part of refresh, untenable at a 12s auto-refresh
cadence. The column is now Status (starting/running/terminal/crashed/port busy), which is
what the user actually watches. Don't reintroduce git status.

### go/ links architecture
Three-layer stack:
1. `/etc/hosts` — adds `127.0.0.1 go` (one-time setup)
2. Python TCP forwarder as LaunchDaemon — listens on port 80, forwards to port 9080 (one-time setup, runs as root at boot)
3. `ProxyServer` (NWListener on 9080) — reads `/alias` from HTTP path, returns 302 to `http://localhost:PORT`

Setup is done via `osascript` with `with administrator privileges` — runs a shell script that writes the plist to `/Library/LaunchDaemons/` and loads it with `launchctl`. One-time only. Tracked via `@AppStorage("goLinksSystemSetup")`.

`GoLinkStore` saves `[appName: alias]` to UserDefaults key `"goLinks"`. Default alias is `appName.lowercased()`.

`ProxyServer` is path-based (not host-header-based). It reads the first path segment from the HTTP request line as the alias. Do not revert to host-header routing — it doesn't work because the browser sends `Host: 127.0.0.1:9080`, not `Host: alias.go`.

### Menu bar icon
`AppDelegate` holds `NSStatusItem?`. `rebuildMenu()` creates/destroys the status item based on `UserDefaults["menuBarQuickLaunch"]`. Two Combine subscribers trigger `rebuildMenu()`: one on `model.$apps`, one on `NotificationCenter.default.publisher(for: UserDefaults.didChangeNotification)`. The second one ensures toggling the setting in the UI immediately shows/hides the icon.

### Row layout (AppRowView)
Order: play/stop button → app name → go/ alias (if enabled) → port → git → Spacer → action buttons

Column widths (must stay in sync between AppRowView and the header row in ContentView):
- play/stop: 28px (header placeholder: `Color.clear.frame(width: 28)`)
- app name: minWidth 200 (go links on) / 280 (go links off)
- go/ alias: 210px
- port: 90px
- git: 70px

### Port/alias field focus
When editing a port or go/ alias inline, `onChange(of: fieldFocused)` reasserts focus if it drops. This prevents clicking outside from dismissing the editor — only ✓, ✕, or Enter can exit.

### Terminal button
Uses `open -a Terminal <path>`, not AppleScript. AppleScript requires entitlements the ad-hoc signed app doesn't have.

### Dark/light mode
Stored in `@AppStorage("colorScheme")` as `"light"` or `"dark"`. Toggle in footer cycles between the two.

### Signing
Ad-hoc only (`codesign --sign -`). No Apple Developer account needed. Users get a Gatekeeper warning on first launch; right-click → Open bypasses it.

### No Xcode project
Never add one. SPM only. No third-party dependencies.
