                "Run is now honest — pressing Run shows \"starting\" with a live timer instead of claiming the app is up. A Convex + Next stack takes ~20 seconds to bind its port; OpenPort used to flag exactly that window as crashed. Crashed now means one thing only: the process actually died (and the log tells you why).",
                "The dashboard watches itself — statuses poll every few seconds, and every ~12s a full sweep adopts whatever port the server really bound and notices servers you started or stopped in a terminal. No more hitting refresh to learn the truth.",
                "Vite finally obeys its port — Vite ignores the PORT env var entirely, so a Vite app always booted on 5173 while OpenPort watched the assigned port. The port now travels as a --port flag (with --strictPort so collisions fail loudly), threaded through convex dev --start wrappers too. Framework detection also sees through npm-run indirection, so convex dev --start \"npm run dev:frontend\" is recognized as Vite.",
                "Opens when ready — after you press Run, the browser opens the app the moment its port answers, instead of you clicking the globe into a dead tab. Toggle in Settings → General.",
                "Status column replaces Git — starting / running / terminal / crashed / port busy, live. The Git column is gone (and with it a git call per project per refresh)."

                "openport.json — drop this file in a project root and OpenPort stops guessing what Run means. It's the fix for projects whose dev command hides behind a launcher script (node scripts/dev.mjs), where the port isn't in package.json for us to find: OpenPort would auto-assign a port, watch it forever, and flag the app as crashed while it was serving happily on a different one.",
                "One Run, several stacks — the \"run\" array can list more than one command. The first owns the row's port and status; the rest start with it and stop with it, each on its own port. A repo running two frontends against two backends now takes one click instead of two terminal tabs.",
                "Declared commands run verbatim — no port patching, no injected host flags. If you wrote it, that's what executes.",
                "A declared port outranks a stored one, so a project that picked up a wrong auto-assigned port corrects itself on the next scan. Declaring \"backend\" also settles the Convex/Supabase chip instead of leaving it to sniffing, and \"framework\" plus \"caches\" tell Clean Restart which build dirs to wipe (all of them, for a multi-stack repo)."

                "Clean Restart — right-click any app and pick \"Clean Restart\" to stop it, delete its framework build cache, and start fresh in one move. This is the fix for the dev server that wedges on compile: port open, CPU pegged, but the page never loads, and a normal Stop→Run doesn't help because it reuses the same poisoned cache. OpenPort knows which cache to wipe per framework (Next's .next, Vite/SvelteKit's node_modules/.vite and .svelte-kit, CRA's node_modules/.cache), so you don't have to drop into a terminal and rm -rf it yourself.",
                "Plain Run stays fast — the cache is only cleared when you explicitly choose Clean Restart, so day-to-day launches don't pay a from-scratch rebuild."

Clicking the footer icon reveals a QR code pointing at the launcher itself, so you can pull it up on a device in the first place.",
                "Auto-expose on Run — while the launcher is on, apps you Run from OpenPort bind to all interfaces automatically (Vite --host, Next -H 0.0.0.0, CRA HOST=0.0.0.0), so the links actually work from your phone without editing each dev script. Apps already running bound to localhost are flagged \"localhost-only\" on the page with a nudge to relaunch from OpenPort.",

Only local deployments (CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT local:/anonymous:, or a localhost URL) still expect a backend process, so the warning fires only when it's real."

No geolocation prompt; it derives your coordinates from the system timezone. Pick it from the appearance menu in the footer or Settings → General.",
                "Backend awareness — OpenPort now detects when a project has a Convex or Supabase backend, whether the dev script already starts it, and whether it's a local process or a cloud connection. Each row shows a backend line under the app name with live status, and warns when a local backend has nothing to start it.",
                "dev:backend sidecar — when a project splits its frontend and backend into separate scripts, Run starts both so the frontend doesn't boot alone with failing data calls.",
                "Node version pinning — respects a project's .nvmrc / .node-version when launching, and drops Convex projects to a compatible Node when your default is too new, so the local backend stops failing to deploy \"use node\" actions silently.",
